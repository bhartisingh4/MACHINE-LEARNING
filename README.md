The dataset comprises housing information, including features like “Overall Quality,” “Year Built,” “Total Basement Area,” “Living Area,” and “Sale Price.” In the analysis, techniques such as correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, and data visualization were employed. 
feature selection process:

1. Sequential Feature Selector (SFS): Iteratively adds features to the model based on their correlation with the target variable.
2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Recursively removes the least important features to simplify the model.
